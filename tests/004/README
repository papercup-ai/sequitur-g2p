  github: @vvasily

symptoms:
  When input file is specified with apply option g2p.py clears it and nothing to do:
  ```
  echo HELLO > file.txt
  g2p.py --model conf/g2p_model --apply file.txt
  ```
  After that file.txt is cleared and no any output is displayed.
  ```
  cat file.txt | g2p.py --model conf/g2p_model --apply - works properly
  ```

resolution:
  for the mainApply, direct the output to stdout, not file  applySample variable
  (that file is only for reading)
